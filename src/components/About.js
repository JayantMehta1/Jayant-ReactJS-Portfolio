                Hi, my name is Jayant!
                I am a fourth year Systems Design Engineering student
                at the University of Waterloo graduating in April 2024. I am currently seeking Summer 2023 internships
                in software development and product management roles.  
        </p>
        <p>
                With a passion for software development, I am motivated to 
                ship code that directly impacts users in production. I follow my passion
                through internships, hackathons, and projects. If you want to grab coffee (virtually) or connect for a chat,
                I'd love to meet you.
        </p>
        <p>
                Outside of my development projects and work, I enjoy coaching swimming as a swim instructor, playing basketball, and table tennis.
                You can also find me hiking in the trails with my dog Oscar, especially during the summer months :).
